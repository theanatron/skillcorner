# SkillCorner Open Data + kloppy

The project aims to use SkillCorner broadcast tracking data to develop a model that can accurately identify corner kick situations and provide valuable analytical insights for the coaching staff, specifically in the context of self-analysis. The following approach and methodology will be followed to achieve this goal.


### Data Loading:

- The SkillCorner broadcast tracking data will be loaded using the "kloppy" Python package developed by PySport.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

- As this is the first time exposed with SkillCorner data, exploratory data analysis was conducted to familiarize ourselves with the dataset. This approach was taken because we wanted to see all ends of the dataset and see what we are working with.

### Model and Application Development :

- The next step involves creating a model and application that is capable of identifying a corner kick considering player x, y and ball x, y.

### Installation

To run the code in this repository, please make sure you have the following packages installed:

- kloppy
- pandas
- matplotlib 
- panel
- mplsoccer
